A set of libraries designed for bypassing limitations in Script Builders

## QTpi Libraries

[KeyframeEmulator](https://github.com/QTpiV2/qtpi/tree/main/KeyframeEmulator): Allows you to use KeyframeSequences without uploading them to Roblox.

[IdiotTrolls](https://github.com/QTpiV2/qtpi/tree/main/IdiotTrolls): Sub-libraries for trolling VSB newbies.

## Where is QTpi usable?
QTpi works in any Roblox game, with HTTP Requests enabled (or without)

## Would I need any external scripts to use it?
Nope!<br>
Everything in here is fully capable of being used just by using the samples and documentation provided.

## How do I use QTpi?

### HTTP Requests Enabled:
1. Select the library you'd like to use from the list above, and open `sample.lua`.
2. Copy the code from `sample.lua` into a Script, and then modify it the way you'd like to use it.

### HTTP Requests Disabled:
1. Select the library you'd like to use from the list above, and open `sample_nohttp.lua`.
2. Copy the code from `sample_nohttp.lua` into a Script, and then modify it the way you'd like to use it.
3. Copy the module code from `module.lua` into a ModuleScript, of which should be parented to the script.
4. Make sure that ModuleScript is named exactly what the library is named, or it won't work properly.

Documentation is available in each library's `README.MD`.
